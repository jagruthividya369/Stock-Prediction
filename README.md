# Stock-Prediction
Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock
or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's
future price could yield significant profit. The efficient-market hypothesis suggests that stock
prices reflect all currently available information and any price changes that are not based on
newly revealed information thus are inherently unpredictable. Others disagree and those
with this viewpoint possess myriad methods and technologies which purportedly allow them
to gain future price information.
Ever since COVID 19 strike, markets loom under fear as uncertainty prevails. lt has sent
markets around the world crashing to levels not witnessed since the Global Financial Crisis
of 2008. Following the strong correlation with the trends and indices of the global market as
BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 fell by 38 per cent.
The challenge of the stock price forecast is the most crucial component for companies and
equity traders to predict future revenues. A successful and accurate prediction to the future
stock prices ultimately results in profit maximization.
